          Narendra Modi’s inspiring life journey to the Office of Prime Minister
          began in the by-lanes of Vadnagar, a small town in North Gujarat’s
          Mehsana district. He was born on the 17th of September 1950; three
          years after India had gained its Independence. This makes him the
          first Prime Minister to be born in independent India. Mr. Modi is the
          third child born to Damodardas Modi and Hiraba Modi. Mr. Modi comes
          from a family of humble origins and modest means. The entire family
          lived in a small single storey house which was approximately 40 feet
          by 12 feet.
