    <h4><u><b>Defining UI & UX design</font></b></u></h4>  
    <p>People sometimes confuse the two, but UI is actually a specialized subset of UX. According to Figma Designer Advocate Hugo Raymond, engaging UI lays the foundation for a positive overall user experience with a digital product or website. "Effective user interface design brings together usability and interactive design to build an emotive connection between users and products," he explains. </p>

    <li>Page layout. Ideally, the organization of a web page or mobile app screen should seem intuitive to users. But to organize it that way, UI designers have to make dozens of well-considered decisions—from the header position to the amount of white space.</li>
    <li>Color scheme and font selection. UI designers carefully choose the colors and fonts on a digital product interface for consistency, accessibility, and brand alignment.</li>
    <li>Interactive elements. From button design to drop-down menus, UI designers style digital product screens to make user flows intuitive.</li>
    <li>Wireframe and prototype fidelity. UX designers often put together basic wireframes and prototypes. UI designers can help transform them into high-fidelity, functional, interactive product mockups</li>
    </ol>

    <li>Consumer and competitor research
        To deliver a positive user experience, UX designers need to understand their target audience. Through UX research, they discover what their users like, what problems and pain points they’re facing, and how they behave online or while using an app or software. UX designers may also perform competitor analysis using a SWOT analysis template to define their product niche.</li>
    <li>Information architecture
        Once UX designers understand users’ needs and behaviors, they can create information architecture (IA) for their product or site. Designers use IA as a visual blueprint, outlining essential navigation, content hierarchy, features, and interactions.</li>
    <li>Wireframes and prototypes
        With IA sketched out, UX designers can start turning ideas into tangible models, such as wireframes and prototypes. Teams use these proofs of concept to test ideas, define requirements, and set feature priorities. Figma's online prototypes facilitate collaboration among designers, developers, and product owners, bringing everyone together to produce a more responsive, accessible, usable, and engaging end product.</li>
    <li>Testing and troubleshooting
        Product mockup tools created by Figma's community of professional designers help UX designers, developers, and product owners see how features will work in practice. If testing reveals issues like confusing navigation, menus, or forms, the team can adjust them before launch.</li>
