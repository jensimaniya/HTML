    <p>Since UX and UI designers often work closely together, it’s common for UX and UI to be confused with one another — even though they represent different components of a product or service’s design. While there is some overlap between the two roles, there are several key differences to consider.</p>
    <ul type="square"><li><font face="serif" color="blue">Look vs. Feel</font></li></ul>
    <p>UX and UI design play related, but different roles in a product’s development. UI design involves the look of a product — namely, the visual components and interactive elements that contribute to a strong user experience. Meanwhile, UX design focuses on the overarching feel of the product or service and the components that will lead to a meaningful, relevant experience for users. </p>
    
    <ul type="square"><li><font face="serif" color="blue">Design vs. Prototyping</font></li></ul>
    <p>UX and UI designers might work on the same product, but they have different duties and goals. UX designers often create wireframes and testable prototypes that form the basis of a website or service’s user flow, while UI designers finalize products and designs that drive user engagement. 
    </p>
    <ul type="square"><li><font face="serif" color="blue">High-Level vs. Details</font></li></ul>
    <p>Another difference between UI and UX designers is the level of detail that goes into their work. UI designers work on individual pages, buttons, and interactions; making sure they are polished and functional. UX designers take a more high-level view of a product or service, ensuring the collective user flow of a site, service, or app is fully realized and consistent.</p>
