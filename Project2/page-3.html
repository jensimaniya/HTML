    <p>Typically, UX designers work with a broader design team to create products and services for an organization. This process involves planning, developing strategy, executing, and analyzing projects after implementation. UX designers spend a lot of time planning for future projects, analyzing existing designs, and tracking the performance of their designs. </p>
    <ul><li><b>Consumer Research</b></li></ul>
    <p>The best UX designs are driven by research, which informs UX designers about their problems and what can be solved by a specific design. UX research can involve questionnaires, surveys, focus groups, product testing, or other research methodologies. The specific research methodologies depend on what a company wants to know about a product or its users.
 </p>
 <p>
    For example, qualitative data from interviews can show an organization how consumers feel about a product or service, while quantitative data from surveys can show how users view or utilize a new feature or redesign. Developing the right type of research can have a major impact on a productâ€™s performance.</p>
